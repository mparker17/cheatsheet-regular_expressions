# Regular expressions cheat sheet

A regular expressions cheat sheet. Created in OmniGraffle 5.4.

# Motivation

I have trouble remembering the regular expression syntax, and apparently other people do to, so I wrote a cheat sheet.

## Why OmniGraffle?

I made the cheat sheet in OmniGraffle, a closed-source piece of software, because I happened to have it around, and I knew I'd be accomplish what I wanted using it.

I used OmniGraffle version 5 because that's what I happen to have a license for.

I'm open to switching to a more-open format, but I haven't had time to learn another program and port the cheat sheet.
